# Clicky Game


## Description
Game loads.  You see 12 pictures.  Click on one picture, and the picures will shuffle.  Click on a picture - but not one you have previously clicked.  Try and see how many unique pictures you can click before you lose.  If you click all 12 pictures without clicking the same one twice, you're a bona fide genius.  If not, it's okay, try again!

## Motivation
Attempting to finish bootcamp homework

## Results
I did it.  I can't believe it.

## Team Efforts
* layout - ME
* coding - ME
* Gittin' the hub - ME
* Everything else - ME

### Challenges
* Overcoming Panic Attacks 101
* So, it worked locally just fine.  When I deployed to Heroku, it added a slash before each of my picture files, so the framework was fine, but it couldn't load the pics. Hur Dur.  I had to go find where that was (data.json) and push to the master - still didn't work.  turns out i had to do another npm run build.  still didn't work - but it was a browser cacheing issue.  opened a private browser and lo and behold it was amazeballs.  

## Improvements
* absolutely nothing.  it is perfect.

## THE END
